# Leetcode-111.-Minimum-Depth-of-Binary-Tree
# 🌱 Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree

Ever wondered how shallow a binary tree can be?  
This project finds the **minimum depth** from the root node to the nearest **leaf node** 🌿 using a **recursive depth-first search (DFS)** approach.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Traverses the binary tree recursively 🔁  
- Tracks the **shortest path** from the root to any leaf node  
- Leaf node = a node with **no left or right child**  
- Returns the smallest depth found across all paths 🧠

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity

| Operation              | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Recursive DFS Traversal | O(n)             | O(h)             |

- **n** = total number of nodes in the tree  
- **h** = height of the tree (depth of recursive calls)
